Blah Blah, who needs an intro?

Basically, download and unzip into directories eclipse and tomcat.

Launch eclipse, install subclipse.

Use subclipse to check-out the code, then in future go to the team-synchronizing perspective to update / commit.

Go to preferences->servers->runtime environments and add the tomcat server there
Go to the project, run as 'on server' and then select your server.

The gods being willing, you have now got it up and running :)
